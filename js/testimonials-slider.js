                stylish house right in the middle of the Norwegian forest in some magazine. I thought then
                that I also want to live in such a house. This dream came true a few months ago on a tour of
                Norway. I am very happy! Thanks, guys!</p>

                spent nights in good hotels with excellent breakfasts. My daughter always had something to
                eat, and the nature in Norway fascinated her even more than us!</p>

                last night, right at midnight, the clouds left, and I saw it! It was magical!</p>
